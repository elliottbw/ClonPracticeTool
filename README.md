# ClonPracticeTool
A tool for Clone Hero charts to generate charts with looped sections of varying speeds.

Inspired by the classic 3999 charts which challenged players to improve their consistency with sections enough to FC them as many times in a row as it would take to get to the old GH3 note limit, this tool allows players to loop sections as many times as they want and generate a fresh chart for it. 

The main advantage is that this tool allows you to gradually speed up sections as they loop, in customisable increments down to as low as 0.1%. This is much finer than Clone Hero's speed increments of 5%. 

Another advantage is that you no longer have to press a button to restart the section, or wait a long time for the section to restart by itself, as the delay between loops is customisable.

The tool is runnable from the command-line or as a GUI.
